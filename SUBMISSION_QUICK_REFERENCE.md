## Full-Stack Leaderboard Application with User Management and Point System

This project is a full-stack leaderboard application built with React frontend and Node.js backend that enables dynamic user management and point tracking. Users can select from a list of participants, claim random points (1-10 range), and view real-time rankings that automatically update based on total scores.

The application features a clean Material-UI interface, persistent MongoDB database storage for user data and point history, responsive design for cross-device compatibility, and production deployment on Render's free tier.

Key functionalities include user creation, point claiming with random generation, leaderboard sorting, detailed point history tracking, and seamless CRUD operations with proper error handling and loading states.
